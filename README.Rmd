`gs` is a grammar of recurring calendar events, implemented as an R 
package. It enables users to easily create and work with schedules, even in 
cases when the pattern of events is irregular. `gs` does this by 
providing a set of simple to understand functions for making schedules along 
with functions for combining them to form more complex ones.

The `gs` grammar is both flexible and declarative. The flexibility 
allows users to compose arbitrarily complex schedules from simple and 
intuitive buildings blocks. Because the grammar is declarative, the user 
need not concern themselves with the details of how a particular schedule 
works, rather they can specify what they want from a schedule and let 
`gs` implement it for them.

## Installation

The package is currently experimental. Users are cautioned against relying on
it for anything of importance. It can be downloaded from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jameslairdsmith/gs")
```

Feedback, contributions, bug report and suggestions are welcome and can be 
made in the [issues tab](https://github.com/jameslairdsmith/gs/issues) 
of the Github repo.

## Getting started

If you have not used `gs` before, the best place to get started is the
introductory [vignette](https://jameslairdsmith.github.io/gs/articles/intro.html).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend an enormous thank you to the [authors][authors] of and 
[contributors][contributors] to the `lubridate` package. `gs` relies 
on `lubridate` for much of its functionality and builds explicitly on its 
syntax.

I would also like to thank [Martin Fowler][fowler], whose writing[^2] on this 
topic helped guide my thinking in a number of important ways.

Finally I'd also like to thank Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham who in 
their paper[^1] on `lubridate` inspired me to create `gs` and pointed 
me in Fowler's direction:

> In particular, we hope to create methods for R that work with reoccurring
temporal date patterns, which were introduced by Fowler (1997).
