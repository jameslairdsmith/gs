# scheduler

Recurring calendar events are very common in everyday life. While some kinds are
straightforward to deal with, others are difficult to conceptualise and therefore
difficult to program with.

The goal of `scheduler` is to make dealing with recurring calendar events a little
easier by providing both a conceptual framework in which they can be constructed
and tools that allow users to program with them.

The package is in the early development stage and experimental. It can be 
downloaded from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jameslairdsmith/scheduler")
```
