# scheduler

*Make working with recurring calendar events a little easier.*

## Overview

Recurring calendar events are very common in everyday life. When they
occur in regular or quasi-regular patterns they are called ‘schedules’.
Schedules can and do take many forms. While some are straightforward,
others are complex making them difficult to conceptualise, use and
program with.

`scheduler` is an R package the goal of which is to make dealing with
these schedules a little easier. It does this by providing a set of
simple to understand functions and a flexible framework for using them
together. Together these allow users to compose more complex schedules
from simple and intutive buildings blocks.

## Installation

The package is in the early development stage and experimental. Users
are cautioned against relying on it for anything of importance. It can
be downloaded from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jameslairdsmith/scheduler")
```
