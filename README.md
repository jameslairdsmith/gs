# scheduler

Recurring calendar events are very common in everyday life. While some
kinds are straightforward to deal with, others are difficult to
conceptualise and therefore difficult to program with.

The goal of `scheduler` is to make dealing with recurring calendar
events a little easier by providing both a conceptual framework in which
they can be constructed and tools that allow users to program with them.

The package is in the early development stage and experimental. It can
be downloaded from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jameslairdsmith/scheduler")
```
