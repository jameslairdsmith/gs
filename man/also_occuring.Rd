\usage{
also_occuring(x, y)

only_occuring(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Schedules to weave together.}
}
\value{
A schedule of events determined by the input schedules and rules
of the function used.
}
\description{
These functions combine schedules by taking two of them as inputs and
returning a single combined schedule as output.
}
\details{
\code{also_occuring()} returns a schedule of events which includes all those
present in the first schedule (\code{x}) and all those present in the second
schedule (\code{y}). The results is the \strong{union} of the two schedules.

\code{only_occuring()} returns a schedule of events which includes only those
present in both the first schedule (\code{x}) and in the second schedule
(\code{y}). The result is the \strong{intersection} of the two schedules.
